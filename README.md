# Overview
This project implements a basic chatbot using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model. The chatbot allows users to interact with it by sending messages and receiving responses generated by the RAG model. The backend is developed in Java and utilizes a vector database (Zilliz/Supabase) for storing embeddings, while the frontend is implemented using HTML/CSS/JS.

# Features
Upload text or documents for training the RAG model
Chat interface for interacting with the chatbot
Basic user interface for uploading documents and chatting
Backend
The backend of the chatbot provides the following APIs:

# Upload API
Endpoint: /api/upload
Method: POST
Description: Uploads a text or document file for training the RAG model. The text is converted into chunks, embeddings are generated, and stored in the vector database.
Chat API
Endpoint: /api/chat
Method: POST
Description: Accepts user queries and generates responses using the trained RAG model.
# Frontend
The frontend of the chatbot consists of two basic pages:

# Upload Page
Description: Allows users to upload text or documents for training the RAG model.
Chat Page
# Description: Provides a simple chat interface where users can send messages and receive responses from the chatbot.
Setup
Clone the repository:

# bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/koyyana/sunbase-task.git
Install dependencies:

# bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
npm install
Configure backend:

Set up the Java environment and install required dependencies.
Configure the vector database (Zilliz/Supabase) and update the connection details in the backend code.
# Run the application:

Start the backend server.
Open the frontend application in a web browser.
Usage
Access the upload page to submit text or documents for training the RAG model.
Once trained, navigate to the chat page to interact with the chatbot.
Enter messages in the chat interface and receive responses from the chatbot.
